# materialize-boilerplate

Boilerplate using Materialize. 

## Purpose

This is my customizations for [Materialize](https://materializecss.com); of course there are multiple other Materialize RTL packages out there, but I wanted to have my own, so I've started this project.

**NOTE**

If you plan to use it remember it might be incomplete or probabely buggy so use it at your own risk :-]

## Development Rules:

Sometime I might add some changes while doing a project which this repository is used within, this may cause inconsistencies or multiple version of customization, for making life easier I decided to have a list of rules (a checklist) which follows:

- All the changes made to **Materialize** to make it RTL-friendly *must* be applied to `./rtl/rtl.css`.
- This repository must be used as upstream and all changes should drive from the latest version. **_Pulling latest changes_** is strongly recommended.
